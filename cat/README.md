# CatPhotoApp Project

CatPhotoApp is a simple HTML web page that features information and images related to cats. This project showcases the use of HTML tags and attributes to structure and display content on a web page.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file with the following structure:

- `<html>`: The root element of the HTML document.
- `<body>`: The main content of the web page.
- `<link>`: A link to an external stylesheet (the `href` attribute should contain the path to your CSS file).
- `<main>`: The main content section of the web page.

Inside the `<main>` section, the page is divided into several `<section>` elements, each containing a specific category of content:

### Cat Photos Section
- `<h1>`: The main title of the web page, "CatPhotoApp."
- `<h2>`: Subtitle for the "Cat Photos" section.
- `<p>`: A paragraph containing a link to an external website that displays cat photos.
- `<a>`: An image with a link to an external cat photo, including alt text.

### Cat Lists Section
- `<h2>`: Subtitle for the "Cat Lists" section.
- Two lists:
  - An unordered list (`<ul>`) of things that cats love.
  - An ordered list (`<ol>`) of things that cats hate.
- Each list contains list items (`<li>`) describing what cats love and hate.
- Two images with captions within `<figure>` elements.

### Cat Form Section
- `<h2>`: Subtitle for the "Cat Form" section.
- A `<form>` element with two fieldsets, each containing input options related to a cat's indoor/outdoor status and personality.
- Text input for a cat photo URL.
- A submit button.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the HTML file to your local machine.
2. Open the HTML file using a web browser to view the CatPhotoApp.

## Customization

You can customize this project by:
- Adding your own CSS styles to the linked stylesheet.
- Modifying the content within the `<main>` sections.
- Changing the links, images, and descriptions to suit your preferences.
